# BetterRest 💤  
**BetterRest** is a smart sleep calculator app that uses machine learning to help users determine the best time to go to bed or wake up for an optimal rest. Built with SwiftUI and CoreML, it demonstrates how to combine modern UI design with intelligent features.  

## 📖 About the Project  
Getting a good night's sleep is essential for health and productivity. **BetterRest** calculates ideal sleep schedules based on user inputs such as desired wake-up time, sleep amount, and caffeine consumption. Powered by Apple's CoreML, it provides data-driven recommendations for better sleep habits.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses CoreML to predict the optimal sleep schedule.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for inputting wake-up time, desired sleep duration, and caffeine intake.  
- **Dynamic Results**: Instant calculation and display of recommended sleep times.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- Swift  
- SwiftUI  
- CoreML for sleep prediction  

## 💡 Key Learnings
